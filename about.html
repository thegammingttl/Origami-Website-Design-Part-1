    Hello Human!<br>
    My name is Vinayak Hakhu<br>
    I am just an average human like you. I like to eat curry and I love maths and science. If you want to know more about me check out my YouTube channel and/or my Instagram page! By the way, if you want to see the person that made the images check out their website here: https://origami.me/ <br>
    Have a nice day! 😁<br>
